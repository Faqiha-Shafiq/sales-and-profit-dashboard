# sales-and-profit-dashboard
This project showcases an interactive Sales & Profit Dashboard developed in Microsoft Excel using a dummy dataset of 1000 sales records from major cities in Pakistan. The dataset includes fields such as Order ID, Date, City, Product Category, Product, Units Sold, Unit Price, Sales, Cost, Profit, Customer Gender, and Customer Age.
The dashboard highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin %, and presents insights through a variety of charts such as monthly sales trends, profit by product category, sales distribution by city, and top-performing products. To enhance interactivity, the dashboard uses PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and a timeline filter, allowing users to explore the data from different perspectives.
